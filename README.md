# Heatdisease-prediction
The Heart Disease Prediction System is a machine learningâ€“based application designed to predict the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on key health parameters. The system analyzes medical data such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol level, blood sugar, heart rate, and other clinical measurements.

By applying various machine learning algorithms (such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machine), the model learns patterns from historical patient data and predicts the presence or absence of heart disease for new inputs.

The goal of this project is to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in early diagnosis and preventive care, reducing the risk of severe cardiac events. The system provides an efficient, data-driven approach to support medical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

## Key Features:

Data preprocessing and feature selection for accuracy improvement.

Implementation of multiple ML algorithms for comparison.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

User-friendly interface for entering patient details and viewing predictions.
